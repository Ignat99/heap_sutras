Transcendental sorting

Translated from Pascal to C (12 Mar 2005).

I like this data structure more than Linked_list. 

Because sorting does not require additional memory and the theoretical wait time for sorting is less. 

It is also essentially a DAG (Directed acyclic graph), which is fashionable in modern cluster systems, that is, it is easy to parallelize the algorithm on Hadoop or Spark.
